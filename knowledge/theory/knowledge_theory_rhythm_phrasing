# Rhythm and Phrasing in Jazz

## Swing Feel

### Definition
Swing = Uneven eighth notes. First eighth is longer, second is shorter. Not triplets, but somewhere between straight and triplet feel.

**Notation:** Written as even eighths, played with swing.

### How to Swing
- First eighth: ~2/3 of beat
- Second eighth: ~1/3 of beat
- Feel is relaxed, "bouncy"
- Listen to Count Basie, Duke Ellington for classic swing

### Common Mistake
Swinging too hard (full triplets). Subtle swing sounds better.

## Syncopation

### Definition
Emphasis on off-beats or weak beats. Creates rhythmic interest.

**Examples:**
- Accenting upbeats ("and" of beats)
- Anticipating chord changes (playing chord early)
- Delayed arrivals (playing chord late)

### Bebop Syncopation
Bebop lines often begin on upbeats, accent displaced beats.

**Practice:** Play scales starting on "and" of beat. Accent off-beats.

## Playing Behind/Ahead of Beat

### Behind the Beat
Play slightly after the beat. Creates laid-back, relaxed feeling.
**Artists:** Lester Young, Dexter Gordon

### Ahead of the Beat
Play slightly before beat. Creates urgent, driving feeling.
**Artists:** Charlie Parker, John Coltrane (early)

### On the Beat
Precise timing. Creates clarity, authority.
**Artists:** Miles Davis (modal period)

### Practice
Use metronome. Play: 1) on beat, 2) slightly behind, 3) slightly ahead. Feel the difference.

## Rhythmic Displacement

### Definition
Shift a pattern forward or backward by a beat or fraction.

**Example:**
Original pattern: Start beat 1
Displaced: Start beat 2 (shifted by one beat)

Creates surprise, rhythmic complexity without changing notes.

### Application
Take a lick. Play it starting on beat 1, then beat 2, then beat 3. Each sounds different!

## Phrasing

### Phrase = Musical Sentence
Like speech, music has phrases: beginning, middle, end. Good phrasing = good storytelling.

### Phrase Length
- **Short phrases (2-4 bars):** Punchy, call-and-response style
- **Long phrases (8+ bars):** Flowing, developmental

**Variety is key!** Mix short and long.

### Breath Marks
Even on non-wind instruments, think about breathing. Pause at phrase end (like speech).

## Motivic Development

### Definition
Start with simple motif (2-4 notes). Develop it throughout solo.

**Techniques:**
- **Repetition:** Play motif again
- **Sequence:** Play motif higher/lower
- **Rhythmic variation:** Change rhythm, keep pitches
- **Interval variation:** Change intervals, keep rhythm

### Example
**Motif:** C-D-E (three ascending notes)
**Development:**
- Repeat: C-D-E, C-D-E
- Sequence: D-E-F, E-F-G
- Rhythmic: C--D-E (longer first note)
- Intervallic: C-Eb-G (larger intervals)

### Result
Coherent solo. Listener can follow your logic.

## Call and Response

### Concept
Musical conversation. Statement → Answer.

**Solo Example:**
- Play phrase → Pause (rest)
- Play answering phrase → Pause
- Back and forth

### With Rhythm Section
- Solo plays idea
- Rhythm section answers (piano fills, drum accent)
- Creates interactive music

### Practice
Record yourself playing 4-bar phrases. Leave 4-bar spaces. Fill them in later.

## Rhythmic Complexity

### Simple Rhythms
Quarter notes, even eighths. Clear, sing-able.

### Complex Rhythms
Tuplets (5-lets, 7-lets), metric modulation, polyrhythms. Adds sophistication.

### Balance
Too simple = boring. Too complex = chaotic.
**Goal:** Mix simple and complex. Tension and release.

## Accents and Dynamics

### Accents
Emphasize certain notes. Guides listener's ear.

**Where to accent:**
- Guide tones (3rd, 7th)
- Chord changes (new chord arrival)
- Peak of phrase
- Syncopated notes

### Dynamics
Volume changes create drama.

**Techniques:**
- **Crescendo:** Get louder over phrase
- **Decrescendo:** Get softer
- **Sudden changes:** Loud-soft-loud creates surprise

## Rest and Space

### Power of Silence
Silence is as important as sound. Gives listener time to process.

**Quote:** "The notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the notes—ah, that is where the art resides." —Arthur Schnabel

### Using Rests
- End of phrases
- Build anticipation
- Give rhythm section space
- Dramatic effect

**Practice:** Play 4 bars, rest 2 bars. Forces intentional phrasing.

## Tempo Relationships

### Double-Time Feel
Play twice as fast rhythmically over same tempo. Creates excitement without changing tempo.

### Half-Time Feel
Play half as fast. Creates space, contrast.

### Metric Modulation
Actually change tempo mid-song. Complex but effective for variety.

## Rhythmic Exercises

**Exercise 1: Metronome Displacement**
Set metronome to slow tempo. Assign click to beat 2 and 4 (backbeat), not 1 and 3. Practice.

**Exercise 2: Polyrhythm**
Play 3 against 4. One hand plays 3 notes, other plays 4, in same time space.

**Exercise 3: Rhythmic Patterns**
Choose scale. Play it in different rhythms: all quarters, all eighths, triplets, syncopated pattern.

**Exercise 4: One-Note Rhythm**
Play single note (e.g., C). Create interesting solo using ONLY rhythm (no pitch variety). Forces rhythmic creativity.

## Summary

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Swing:** Uneven eighths, subtle bounce
2. **Syncopation:** Off-beat accents
3. **Placement:** Behind/on/ahead of beat
4. **Displacement:** Shift patterns rhythmically
5. **Phrasing:** Musical sentences, variety in length
6. **Motific Development:** Evolve simple ideas
7. **Space:** Use rests strategically
8. **Dynamics:** Volume changes add drama

**Practice:** Record yourself. Are phrases clear? Is there variety? Are you using space effectively?
