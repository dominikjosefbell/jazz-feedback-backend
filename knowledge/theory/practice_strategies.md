# Practice Strategies and Methods

## Daily Practice Routine

### Time Allocation (60-90 min session)
- **Warm-up (10 min):** Long tones, scales, basic technique
- **Technique (20 min):** Patterns, difficult passages, speed building
- **Theory/Ear Training (15 min):** Chord progressions, intervals, transcription
- **Repertoire (30 min):** Learn standards, practice solos
- **Free Play (15 min):** Jam, experiment, fun

**Key:** Consistency > Marathon sessions. 60 min daily beats 5 hours once/week.

## Pattern Practice in 12 Keys

### Why All 12 Keys?
Jazz modulates constantly. Must be fluent in all keys.

### Method
1. Learn pattern in one key (e.g., C)
2. Practice in all keys around circle of 5ths
3. Increase tempo gradually
4. Aim for same fluency in all keys

### Essential Patterns
- **ii-V-I:** All 12 keys, all tempos
- **Bebop scales:** All keys
- **Arpeggios (maj7, m7, dom7, m7b5):** All keys
- **Guide tone lines:** All keys

**Goal:** No "difficult keys." All keys equally comfortable.

## Metronome Work

### Progressive Click Practice
**Week 1:** Click on all 4 beats
**Week 2:** Click on beats 2 & 4 (backbeat)
**Week 3:** Click only on 3 or 4  
**Week 4:** Click on just "and" of 2 (very challenging!)

**Develops:** Internal time, independence

### Tempo Building
Start slow (60% of target tempo). Increase 5 BPM per week once comfortable.

**Example:** Target = 180 BPM
- Week 1: 110 BPM
- Week 2: 115 BPM
- Week 12: 180 BPM

**Patience:** Rushing leads to sloppiness.

## Play-Along Tracks

### Benefits
- Practice with "band"
- Feel of playing with others
- Improve timing, phrasing
- Build confidence

### Resources
- **Jamey Aebersold:** 100+ play-along books (all levels)
- **iReal Pro app:** Thousands of standards, customizable
- **YouTube:** Backing tracks for most standards

### Method
1. Listen to play-along (no instrument)
2. Play melody with track
3. Improvise one chorus
4. Gradually increase choruses
5. Record yourself, evaluate

## Chunking Difficult Passages

### Problem
Can't play fast/complex passage at tempo.

### Solution
Break into small chunks (2-4 notes).

**Process:**
1. Master chunk 1 slowly
2. Master chunk 2 slowly
3. Connect chunks 1+2
4. Master chunk 3
5. Connect 1+2+3
6. Continue until full passage

**Increase tempo:** Only after 100% accurate at slow tempo.

**Result:** Can play anything given enough time.

## Recording Yourself

### Why Record?
You hear things when listening back that you miss while playing.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Time:** Rushing? Dragging?
- **Tone:** Consistent? Pleasant?
- **Notes:** Wrong notes? Correct but not swinging?
- **Phrasing:** Clear? Interesting?
- **Space:** Using rests effectively?

### Frequency
Record practice sessions weekly. Review monthly for progress tracking.

### Tools
- Phone voice recorder (simple)
- Audio interface + DAW (professional)
- Video (see technique issues)

## Goal Setting

### SMART Goals
- **Specific:** "Learn 'Autumn Leaves'" not "Get better"
- **Measurable:** "Play 10 ii-V-I licks in all keys"
- **Achievable:** Realistic for your level
- **Relevant:** Matches your interests
- **Time-bound:** "Within 2 weeks"

### Example Goals
- Learn 5 new standards this month
- Transcribe 8 bars of Parker solo
- Master ii-V-I at 160 BPM in all keys
- Perform at open jam session

## Learning Standards

### Process
**Day 1-2:** Learn melody by ear. Sing it.
**Day 3-4:** Learn chord changes. Play them (comp).
**Day 5-6:** Improvise slowly over changes.
**Day 7-10:** Increase tempo. Learn in all keys (transpose).
**Day 11-14:** Perform it. Record it.

### Standard Repertoire Priority
1. **Blues in Bb, F:** Foundation
2. **Rhythm Changes:** "I Got Rhythm" (common vehicle)
3. **Essential Standards:** Autumn Leaves, All the Things You Are, Stella By Starlight
4. **Jazz Classics:** So What, Blue Bossa, Cantaloupe Island

**Goal:** 50 standards memorized and performance-ready.

## Mental Practice

### Visualization
Close eyes. Imagine playing. Hear sound, see fingers, feel instrument.

**Research:** Mental practice activates same brain areas as physical practice!

### Away From Instrument
- Sing melodies
- Analyze charts mentally
- Listen actively (focused listening)
- Visualize performances

**Benefit:** Practice anywhere. Reinforces learning.

## Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Always Playing Fast:** Slow practice builds accuracy
2. **No Metronome:** Develops poor time
3. **Only Playing Fun Stuff:** Must do technical work too
4. **Not Recording:** Can't hear own mistakes
5. **No Goals:** Directionless practice wastes time
6. **Comparing to Masters:** Compare to YOUR past self

## Progress Tracking

### Practice Journal
**Log Daily:**
- What practiced
- How long each section
- Tempos achieved
- Problems encountered
- Breakthroughs

**Review Monthly:** See patterns. Adjust strategy.

### Benchmarks
Test yourself monthly:
- ii-V-I speed test (max tempo clean)
- Number of standards memorized
- Length of comfortable improvisation
- Transcription count

**Celebrate progress!**

## Sample Weekly Schedule

**Monday:** Technique (scales, patterns) + Standard #1
**Tuesday:** Ear training + Transcription
**Wednesday:** Repertoire (Standards #2, #3) + Improvisation
**Thursday:** Theory (reharmonization, analysis) + Standard #1
**Friday:** Technique + Free improvisation
**Saturday:** Jam session or performance
**Sunday:** Rest or light review

**Adapt to your schedule!**
