## Bebop Scales

### Major Bebop Scale

**Formula:** 1 2 3 4 5 ♯5 6 7

**Example in C:**
C - D - E - F - G - G♯ - A - B

**Usage:**
- Use over major 7th chords (Cmaj7)
- The extra chromatic note (♯5) creates smooth voice leading
- Perfect for descending lines over I chords

**Practice Tip:**
Play ascending and descending through the scale, emphasizing chord tones (1, 3, 5, 7) on downbeats.

**Famous Example:**
Charlie Parker frequently used this scale in "Confirmation" over the opening Cmaj7 chord.

---

### Dominant Bebop Scale

**Formula:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 ♭7 7

**Example in G:**
G - A - B - C - D - E - F - F♯

**Usage:**
- Primary scale for dominant 7th chords (G7)
- Extra major 7th creates tension before resolution
- Essential for ii-V-I progressions
- Works perfectly over blues progressions

**Practice Tip:**
Practice this scale over a G7 chord, starting on different scale degrees. Notice how the chromatic passing tone (F to F♯) creates forward motion.

**Famous Example:**
Dizzy Gillespie's "Groovin' High" features extensive use of dominant bebop scales over all the V7 chords.

---

### Minor Bebop Scale

**Formula:** 1 2 ♭3 3 4 5 6 ♭7

**Example in D minor:**
D - E - F - F♯ - G - A - B - C

**Usage:**
- Use over minor 7th chords (Dm7)
- The natural 3rd creates a chromatic approach to the 4th
- Great for ii-V progressions in minor keys

**Practice Tip:**
Practice over the ii chord (Dm7) in a ii-V-i progression. The chromatic note helps connect smoothly to the V chord.

---

### Harmonic Minor Bebop Scale

**Formula:** 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 6 7

**Example in A minor:**
A - B - C - D - E - F - F♯ - G♯

**Usage:**
- Exotic sound over minor chords
- Strong resolution to tonic due to leading tone
- Popular in minor ii-V-i progressions

---

## Modal Scales

### Dorian Mode

**Formula:** 1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 ♭7

**Example in D:**
D - E - F - G - A - B - C

**Usage:**
- The go-to scale for minor 7th chords in jazz
- Brighter sound than natural minor (due to major 6th)
- Perfect for modal jazz (Miles Davis style)

**Characteristic Sound:**
The major 6th gives Dorian its distinctive, hopeful minor quality.

**Practice Tip:**
Practice over a Dm7 vamp. Emphasize the major 6th (B) to bring out the Dorian flavor.

**Famous Example:**
Miles Davis - "So What" (entire melody is based on D Dorian)

---

### Mixolydian Mode

**Formula:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 ♭7

**Example in G:**
G - A - B - C - D - E - F

**Usage:**
- Primary scale for dominant 7th chords
- Major scale with flatted 7th
- Common in modal jazz and blues

**Practice Tip:**
Play Mixolydian over a G7 vamp, avoiding the major 7th (F♯). Notice the relaxed, bluesy quality.

**Famous Example:**
"Impressions" by John Coltrane uses Mixolydian extensively.

---

### Lydian Mode

**Formula:** 1 2 3 ♯4 5 6 7

**Example in C:**
C - D - E - F♯ - G - A - B

**Usage:**
- Beautiful over major 7th chords
- The raised 4th avoids the "avoid note" of regular major scale
- Creates dreamy, floating quality

**Characteristic Sound:**
The ♯4 gives Lydian its distinctive, bright, "open" sound.

**Practice Tip:**
Practice over Cmaj7, emphasizing the F♯. Notice how it creates tension without needing resolution.

**Famous Example:**
"Giant Steps" - Coltrane uses Lydian over the major chords for a modern sound.

---

### Lydian Dominant (Lydian ♭7)

**Formula:** 1 2 3 ♯4 5 6 ♭7

**Example in C:**
C - D - E - F♯ - G - A - B♭

**Usage:**
- Exotic sound over dominant 7th chords
- Common in Latin jazz
- Alternative to Mixolydian

---

## Altered Scales

### Altered Scale (Super Locrian)

**Formula:** 1 ♭2 ♭3 ♭4 ♭5 ♭6 ♭7

**Example in G:**
G - A♭ - B♭ - C♭ - D♭ - E♭ - F

**Usage:**
- Maximum tension on dominant 7th chords
- Contains all altered tensions: ♭9, ♯9, ♯11, ♭13
- Common in modern jazz and bebop
- Perfect for G7alt resolving to Cmaj7

**Think of it as:**
The 7th mode of A♭ melodic minor

**Practice Tip:**
Practice this over V7 chords in ii-V-I progressions. It creates maximum tension before resolving to I.

**Famous Example:**
John Coltrane's "Countdown" uses altered scales extensively.

---

### Half-Whole Diminished Scale

**Formula:** H-W-H-W-H-W-H-W (Half step, Whole step pattern)

**Example in C:**
C - D♭ - E♭ - E - F♯ - G - A - B♭

**Usage:**
- Use over dominant 7♭9 chords (C7♭9)
- Symmetrical scale (repeats every minor 3rd)
- Contains both ♭9 and ♯9
- Great for altered dominant sounds

**Practice Tip:**
This scale transposes every minor 3rd. C dim = E♭ dim = G♭ dim = A dim (same notes!)

---

### Whole-Half Diminished Scale

**Formula:** W-H-W-H-W-H-W-H

**Example in C:**
C - D - E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭ - A - B

**Usage:**
- Use over diminished 7th chords (Cdim7)
- Also symmetrical
- Common in transitions

- THE classic blues scale
- Works over entire 12-bar blues
- The ♭5 (blue note) is the characteristic sound
- Can be used over major or minor blues

**Practice Tip:**
Bend into the ♭5 from below. This is the essence of blues playing.

**Famous Example:**
B.B. King, Eric Clapton - virtually every blues solo

---

### Major Blues Scale

**Formula:** 1 2 ♭3 3 5 6

**Example in C:**
C - D - E♭ - E - G - A

**Usage:**

## Advanced Concepts

### Scale Superimposition

**Technique:** Play a scale from a different root over a chord.

**Example:**
Over Cmaj7, play D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C)
- Creates tensions: 9, 11, 13
- Modern jazz sound
- Used by McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock

### Chromatic Approach

**Technique:** Approach any scale tone chromatically from above or below.

**Example in C major:**
Instead of C-D-E-F-G
Play C-C♯-D-D♯-E-F-F♯-G

**Used extensively in bebop!**
