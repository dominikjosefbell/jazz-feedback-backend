# Advanced Jazz Harmony

## Extended Chords (9th, 11th, 13th)

### Chord Extensions Basics
Jazz harmony extends beyond triads and seventh chords to include tensions: the 9th, 11th, and 13th. These extensions add color and complexity while maintaining the chord's function.

**Extension Numbering:**
- 9th = 2nd octave higher (9 = 2 + 7)
- 11th = 4th octave higher (11 = 4 + 7)  
- 13th = 6th octave higher (13 = 6 + 7)

### Major Chord Extensions
**Cmaj9:** C-E-G-B-D (Root-3-5-7-9)
- Sweet, lush sound
- Used in tonic functions
- Common in ballads and modal jazz

**Cmaj13:** C-E-G-B-D-F-A (adds 9, 11, 13)
- Avoid #11 on major chords (creates dissonance with 3rd)
- Natural 11 typically omitted unless specifically voiced
- Rich, full sound for final chords

### Minor Chord Extensions
**Cm9:** C-Eb-G-Bb-D
- Natural 9 adds brightness to minor quality
- Essential sound in minor ii-V-i progressions

**Cm11:** C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F
- Natural 11 works beautifully with minor chords
- Creates Dorian sound when paired with natural 6
- Common in modal jazz (Dorian mode)

**Cm13:** C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F-A
- Full extension of minor chord
- Natural 13 (6th) creates Dorian flavor
- Used in sophisticated ballad harmonies

### Dominant Chord Extensions
**C9:** C-E-G-Bb-D
- Standard dominant sound with 9th
- Bluesy when played with flatted 3rd (sus b9)

**C13:** C-E-G-Bb-D-F-A
- Complete dominant sound
- Natural 13 implies Mixolydian mode
- Common in blues and swing

## Altered Dominant Chords

### What Are Alterations?
Alterations are chromatic modifications to the 5th, 9th, or 13th of a chord. They create tension that demands resolution.

**Available Alterations:**
- b5 (flatted fifth)
- #5 (raised fifth)  
- b9 (flatted ninth)
- #9 (raised ninth)
- #11 (raised eleventh - technically same as b5)
- b13 (flatted thirteenth - technically same as #5)

### Common Altered Dominants

**C7b9:** C-E-G-Bb-Db
- Spanish/Phrygian sound
- Tension resolves to F (minor or major)
- Common in minor ii-V-i progressions

**C7#9:** C-E-G-Bb-D#
- "Hendrix chord" sound
- Blues feeling
- Combines major 3rd with #9 (minor 3rd up octave)

**C7b5:** C-E-Gb-Bb
- Whole tone sound
- Very dissonant, strong pull to tonic
- Common in altered jazz

**C7#5:** C-E-G#-Bb
- Augmented triad base
- Whole tone feeling
- Creates smooth chromatic motion to tonic

**C7alt (fully altered):** C-E-Gb-Bb-Db-D#-Ab
- Contains b5, #5, b9, #9, b13
- Maximum tension
- Uses altered scale (7th mode of melodic minor)

### Why Alterations Work
Alterations create chromatic voice leading:
- b9 resolves down by half-step to 5th of tonic
- #9 resolves up by half-step to 3rd of tonic  
- b5 resolves down by half-step to 3rd of tonic
- #5 resolves up by half-step to root of tonic

**Example: G7alt → Cmaj7**
- Db (b5) → C (root)
- Ab (b9) → G (5th)
- D# (#9) → E (3rd)
- Maximum chromatic motion = strong resolution

## Melodic Minor and Its Modes

### The Melodic Minor Scale
Unlike classical theory (which differentiates ascending/descending), jazz uses only the "ascending" form:
**C melodic minor:** C-D-Eb-F-G-A-B

**Character:** Minor with major 6th and major 7th. Bright minor sound.

### Seven Modes of Melodic Minor

**Mode I - Melodic Minor (Jazz Minor)**
- Formula: 1-2-b3-4-5-6-7
- Use: Over min(maj7) chords
- Sound: Sophisticated minor, film noir

**Mode II - Dorian b2 (Phrygian #6)**
- Formula: 1-b2-b3-4-5-6-b7
- Use: Over m7 chords with b9
- Sound: Spanish, exotic
- Example: Dm7 with Dorian b2 from D

**Mode III - Lydian Augmented**
- Formula: 1-2-3-#4-#5-6-7
- Use: Over maj7#5 chords
- Sound: Dreamy, mysterious
- Example: Cmaj7#5 with Lydian Augmented from C

**Mode IV - Lydian Dominant (Overtone Scale)**
- Formula: 1-2-3-#4-5-6-b7
- Use: Over dominant 7 chords with natural 13
- Sound: Bright dominant, Simpsons theme
- Example: C7 with Lydian Dominant from C (= 4th mode of G melodic minor)

**Mode V - Mixolydian b6 (Hindu Scale)**
- Formula: 1-2-3-4-5-b6-b7
- Use: Over dominant 7 chords with b13
- Sound: Dark dominant
- Example: C7b13 with Mixolydian b6 from C

**Mode VI - Locrian #2 (Half-Diminished Scale)**
- Formula: 1-2-b3-4-b5-b6-b7
- Use: Over m7b5 chords
- Sound: The go-to scale for half-diminished
- Example: Cm7b5 with Locrian #2 from C

**Mode VII - Altered Scale (Super Locrian, Diminished Whole Tone)**
- Formula: 1-b2-b3-b4-b5-b6-b7
- Use: Over altered dominant 7 chords (7alt)
- Sound: Maximum tension, outside sound
- Example: G7alt with Altered Scale from G (= 7th mode of Ab melodic minor)
- **This is THE scale for altered dominants!**

### Altered Scale Deep Dive

The altered scale is the most important melodic minor mode for jazz:

**G altered scale (from Ab melodic minor):**
G-Ab-Bb-Cb(B)-Db-Eb-F

**Contains ALL alterations:**
- Ab = b9
- Bb = #9 (enharmonically)
- Cb/B = 3rd (chord tone)
- Db = b5 / #11
- Eb = #5 / b13  
- F = b7 (chord tone)

**When to use:**
- Any V7alt in major or minor
- Giant Steps changes (Coltrane)
- Modern jazz, post-bop
- When maximum tension desired

**Practice:** Play altered scale starting on dominant root over 7alt chords.

**Example progression with altered:**
- Dm7 (Dorian) → G7alt (G altered) → Cmaj7 (Ionian/Lydian)

## Chord-Scale Relationships

### The Concept
Every chord has corresponding scales that work for improvisation. The chord-scale relationship matches chord tones with scale degrees.

### Major Key Chord-Scales

**I maj7:** Ionian, Lydian
- Cmaj7: C Ionian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) or C Lydian (C-D-E-F#-G-A-B)
- Lydian preferred for sophisticated sound (#11)

**ii m7:** Dorian
- Dm7: D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C)
- Natural 6 and natural 7 (relative to D)

**iii m7:** Phrygian
- Em7: E Phrygian (E-F-G-A-B-C-D)
- Darker minor with b9 (relative to E)

**IV maj7:** Lydian, Ionian
- Fmaj7: F Lydian (F-G-A-B-C-D-E)
- Lydian preferred (natural 11 = B)

**V7:** Mixolydian, Lydian Dominant, Altered
- G7: G Mixolydian (G-A-B-C-D-E-F)
- G7#11: G Lydian Dominant  
- G7alt: G Altered Scale

**vi m7:** Dorian, Aeolian
- Am7: A Dorian (brighter) or A Aeolian (darker)

**vii m7b5:** Locrian, Locrian #2
- Bm7b5: B Locrian #2 preferred (from C melodic minor)

### Minor Key Chord-Scales

**i min(maj7):** Melodic Minor
- Cm(maj7): C melodic minor

**ii m7b5:** Locrian #2
- Dm7b5: D Locrian #2 (from Eb melodic minor)

**V7 (in minor):** Altered, Harmonic Minor 5th mode
- G7: G Altered Scale or G Harmonic Minor 5th mode (Phrygian Dominant)

### Dominant Chord-Scale Summary

**For Natural Dominant Sound:**
- Mixolydian: Natural extensions
- Lydian Dominant: Bright (#11, natural 13)

**For Altered Dominant Sound:**
- Altered Scale: All alterations (b5, #5, b9, #9, b13)
- Diminished (Half-Whole): b9, #9, natural 5, b13
- Whole Tone: #5, #11

### Practical Application

**Step 1:** Identify chord function (I, ii, V, etc.)
**Step 2:** Choose appropriate scale(s)
**Step 3:** Emphasize guide tones (3rd & 7th)
**Step 4:** Add color tones (9th, 11th, 13th)
**Step 5:** Use scale to connect chord tones

**Example: ii-V-I in C major**
- Dm7: D Dorian → Emphasize F (3rd), C (7th)
- G7: G Altered → Emphasize B (3rd), F (7th) → Add Ab (b9), Db (b5)
- Cmaj7: C Lydian → Emphasize E (3rd), B (7th) → Add F# (#11)

## Tensions vs. Chord Tones

**Chord Tones (Strong, Stable):**
- Root, 3rd, 5th, 7th
- Define chord quality
- Safe landing points

**Tensions (Color, Movement):**
- 9th, 11th, 13th (and alterations)
- Add flavor
- Create motion
- Can sound "wrong" if sustained

**Avoid Notes:**
- Notes that clash with chord tones
- Example: Natural 11 on major chords (clashes with 3rd)
- Example: Natural 9 on diminished chords

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Approach tensions from chord tones
- Resolve tensions to chord tones  
- Or: Move through tensions quickly (passing tones)

## Reharmonization with Extensions

**Basic Chord → Extended Chord:**
- C → Cmaj7 → Cmaj9 → Cmaj13
- Progressive sophistication

**Adds New Voice Leading Possibilities:**
- Extensions can move chromatically to next chord
- Creates smoother, jazzier sound

**Example:**
Original: C → Am → Dm → G7 → C
Extended: Cmaj9 → Am11 → Dm9 → G13 → Cmaj9

The 9ths and other extensions create additional voice leading opportunities.

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Extensions (9, 11, 13) add color while maintaining function
2. Alterations (b5, #5, b9, #9, b13) create tension on dominants
3. Melodic minor modes provide scales for complex chords
4. Altered scale = go-to for V7alt chords
5. Chord-scale theory matches scales to chords for improvisation
6. Guide tones (3rd & 7th) remain crucial with all extensions

**Practice:**
- Play all extensions of maj7, m7, dom7 chords in all keys
- Practice altered scale over 7alt chords
- Learn melodic minor modes from each root
- Apply chord-scale theory to standards
