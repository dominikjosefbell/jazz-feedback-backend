# Bebop Techniques - Master Guide

## Essential Bebop Concepts

### What is Bebop?
Bebop emerged in the 1940s with pioneers like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. It's characterized by:
- Fast tempos (140-300 BPM)
- Complex harmony
- Virtuosic technique
- Improvisation over composition
- Eighth-note lines
- Chromatic approach notes

---

## Chromatic Approach Notes

### Single Chromatic Approach
Approach a chord tone from a half-step above or below.

**Example targeting E:**
- From below: D# → E
- From above: F → E

**In context (Cmaj7):**
- Target 3rd (E): D - D# - E
- Target 5th (G): F# - G or G# - G
- Target root (C): B - C or C# - C

### Double Chromatic Approach
Approach from both sides (enclosure).

**Example targeting E:**
- D# - F - E (below-above-target)
- F - D# - E (above-below-target)

**Usage:**
- Creates bebop sound instantly
- Use on beat 2 and 4 for best effect
- Common in Parker's playing

### Practice Pattern:
```
Over Cmaj7:
C - D - D# - E - D# - D - C (chromatic enclosure of E)
E - F - F# - G - F# - F - E (chromatic enclosure of G)
```

## Bebop Scales Application

### Major Bebop Scale Over Major Chords

**Formula:** 1 2 3 4 5 #5 6 7

**Practice Pattern:**
- Ascending: Place chord tones on downbeats
- Descending: Adjust rhythm to maintain chord tone emphasis
- Sequence in 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths

**Example Lick (Cmaj7):**
```
C D E F | G G# A B | C
```

### Dominant Bebop Scale Over V7 Chords

**Formula:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 ♭7 7

**Why it works:**
- 8 notes = fits perfectly in 4/4 time
- Chord tones on downbeats naturally
- Passing tone (major 7) creates tension → resolution

**Example Lick (G7):**
```
G A B C | D E F F# | G
```

### Minor Bebop Scale Over Minor Chords

**Formula:** 1 2 ♭3 3 4 5 6 ♭7

**Character:**
- Major 3rd creates blues feel
- Works great over ii chords
- Common in hard bop

## Parker Licks (Classic Patterns)

### Lick 1: The "Parker Pickup"
```
Over Dm7 - G7:
(Dm7)  A - B♭ - B - C
(G7)   D - F - E - D
```

**Analysis:**
- Starts on 5th of Dm7
- Uses chromatic passing tones
- Lands on chord tones of G7

### Lick 2: Descending Line
```
Over G7:
B - A - G - F - E - D - C - B
```

**Analysis:**
- Scalar descent from 3rd of G7
- Emphasizes guide tones (B, F)
- Resolves to 3rd of Cmaj7

### Lick 3: Enclosure Pattern
```
Over Cmaj7:
D - F - E | F - G# - G | B♭ - C# - C
```

**Analysis:**
- Each chord tone approached from above and below
- Pure bebop vocabulary
- Very Charlie Parker

### Practice Method:
1. Learn lick slowly with metronome
2. Play in all 12 keys
3. Analyze which notes are chord tones vs. passing tones
4. Create variations
5. Use in improvisation

## Guide Tone Lines

### What are Guide Tones?
The 3rd and 7th of each chord - they define the chord quality.

### Voice Leading with Guide Tones

**ii-V-I in C:**
```
Dm7:  F (3rd) → G7:  F (7th) → Cmaj7: E (3rd)
      C (7th)      B (3rd)          B (7th)
```

**Practice:**
1. Play just guide tones through progression
2. Add connecting chromatic tones
3. Elaborate with full bebop lines

**Example Line:**
```
Dm7:    F - E - E♭
G7:     D - B - C
Cmaj7:  E - D - C
```

---

## Rhythmic Displacement

### Syncopation
- Place accents on weak beats
- Creates forward momentum
- Signature bebop feel

**Example:**
Instead of:
```
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
C   D   E   F
```

Try:
```
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
    C   D   E   F
```

### Triplet Phrases
Mix triplets with eighth notes for variety.

**Example:**
```
C D E (triplet) | F G A B | C
```

---

## Interval Patterns

### Playing in 3rds
```
Over Cmaj7 scale:
C-E, D-F, E-G, F-A, G-B, A-C, B-D, C-E
```

### Playing in 4ths
```
Over Cmaj7 scale:
C-F, D-G, E-A, F-B, G-C, A-D, B-E, C-F
```

### Mixed Intervals (Bebop Style)
```
C-E (3rd) | F-D (descending 3rd) | G-B (3rd) | C
```

---

## Common Bebop Formulas

### Formula 1: Scale - Chromatic - Chord Tone
```
C D E (scale) | F# (chromatic) | G (chord tone)
```

### Formula 2: Arpeggiate Up, Scale Down
```
Up: C E G B (Cmaj7 arpeggio)
Down: B A G F E D C (scale)
```

### Formula 3: Target 3rd on Beat 1
```
Bar 1: (3rd) E - D - C - B
Bar 2: (3rd) E - F - G - A
```

---

## Articulation

### Bebop Accent Patterns
- Emphasize beat 2 and 4 (backbeat)
- Slight accent on chord tones
- Smooth legato for chromatic passages

### Ghost Notes
- Very soft notes between accented notes
- Common in Parker's playing
- Creates rhythmic complexity

**Example:**
```
Loud: E - - G - - B - - C
Soft:   F   A   B♭   D
```

---

## Phrase Construction

### Call and Response
**Call (2 bars):** State melodic idea
**Response (2 bars):** Answer or develop idea

**Example:**
```
Call:     C D E F | G A B C (ascending)
Response: C B A G | F E D C (descending answer)
```

### Building Tension
- Start in lower register
- Gradually move higher
- Increase note density
- Crescendo
- Resolve to chord tone on downbeat

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Playing Too Fast Too Soon
- Master lines slowly first
- Increase tempo gradually
- 60 → 80 → 100 → 120 → 140 BPM

### 2. Ignoring Chord Changes
- Always know where you are harmonically
- Target chord tones
- Don't just run scales

### 3. No Dynamic Variation
- Bebop isn't all forte
- Use dynamics to create phrases
- Crescendo into important notes

### 4. Poor Time Feel
- Practice with metronome
- Accent beat 2 and 4
- Swing the eighth notes

### 5. Not Listening
- Transcribe Parker, Gillespie, Stitt
- Analyze their phrases
- Steal with pride

## Advanced Concepts

### Bitonality
Play one scale over another key center.

**Example:**
- F major scale over Cmaj7 = Lydian sound
- Lydian scale over major = modern sound

### Hexatonic Scales
Six-note scales alternating major 3rds and half-steps.

### Pentatonic Superimposition
Play pentatonic from different roots over chords.

**Example over Cmaj7:**
- D pentatonic = C Lydian sound
- A pentatonic = C major with added color
