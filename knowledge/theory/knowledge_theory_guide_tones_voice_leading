# Guide Tones and Voice Leading

## What Are Guide Tones?

### Definition
Guide tones are the 3rd and 7th of a chord. They are the most harmonically important notes because they define the chord quality.

**Why 3rd and 7th?**
- The **3rd** determines if chord is major or minor
- The **7th** determines if chord is maj7, dom7, or m7
- Together they create the chord's unique identity
- Root and 5th are less distinctive (same for multiple chord types)

### Example Comparison
**All these chords have C root and G fifth:**
- **Cmaj7:** C-E-G-B (3rd=E, 7th=B) → Major sound
- **C7:** C-E-G-Bb (3rd=E, 7th=Bb) → Dominant sound  
- **Cm7:** C-Eb-G-Bb (3rd=Eb, 7th=Bb) → Minor sound
- **Cm7b5:** C-Eb-Gb-Bb (3rd=Eb, 7th=Bb, 5th=Gb) → Half-diminished sound

Notice: Only the 3rd and 7th change to create different qualities!

## Voice Leading Principles

### Fundamental Concepts

**Voice Leading** = The smooth movement of individual notes from one chord to the next.

**Goals of Good Voice Leading:**
1. Minimize distance between notes (smooth transitions)
2. Keep common tones where possible
3. Move voices in contrary or oblique motion (not all same direction)
4. Create melodic interest in each voice

### The Power of Guide Tone Movement

In jazz harmony, guide tones naturally create excellent voice leading:

**Key Pattern: Guide tones either:**
- **Stay the same** (common tone)
- **Move by step** (half or whole step)

This creates the smoothest possible motion!

### Classic Example: Circle of 5ths

**Progression: Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7**

**Guide Tones:**
- **Dm7:** F (3rd), C (7th)
- **G7:** B (3rd), F (7th)  
- **Cmaj7:** E (3rd), B (7th)

**Movement Analysis:**
- Dm7 to G7: F stays F (common tone), C moves to B (half-step)
- G7 to Cmaj7: B stays B (common tone), F moves to E (half-step)

**Notice:** The 3rd of one chord becomes the 7th of the next! This creates perfect voice leading.

## Guide Tone Lines

### What Is a Guide Tone Line?
A guide tone line is a melody created by connecting the 3rd or 7th of each chord in a progression.

**Two possible lines for any progression:**
1. **3rd Line:** Connect all the 3rds
2. **7th Line:** Connect all the 7ths

### Creating Guide Tone Lines

**Step 1:** Write out chord progression
**Step 2:** Extract 3rds from each chord → 3rd Line
**Step 3:** Extract 7ths from each chord → 7th Line
**Step 4:** Play lines as melody while comp changes

**Example: ii-V-I in C**
- Dm7 (F-C) → G7 (B-F) → Cmaj7 (E-B)

**3rd Line:** F → B → E (moves by stepwise motion)
**7th Line:** C → F → B (moves by stepwise motion)

### Voice Leading Rules in Guide Tone Lines

**Rule 1: Minimal Motion**
Guide tones move by the smallest interval possible (usually half or whole step).

**Rule 2: Voice Crossing**
The voices "cross" - the 3rd of one chord becomes the 7th of the next (or vice versa).

**Rule 3: Contrary Motion**
When one guide tone goes up, the other often goes down.

## The Circle of 5ths Progression

### Why It Sounds So Good

The Circle of 5ths (or Cycle of 4ths) creates the smoothest harmonic motion in jazz.

**Progression Pattern:**
Cmaj7 → Fmaj7 → Bm7b5 → Em7 → Am7 → Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7

**Each chord moves down a 5th (or up a 4th) → Strong root motion**

### Guide Tones in Circle Progression

**Magic Pattern:**
- One guide tone **stays the same** (common tone)
- Other guide tone **moves down by step** (half or whole)

**Example: Cmaj7 → Fmaj7**
- **Cmaj7:** E (3rd), B (7th)
- **Fmaj7:** E (7th), A (3rd)
- E stays E (common tone), B→A (whole step down)

This pattern continues around the entire circle!

**Result:** Continuous smooth voice leading = beautiful sound

## Applying Guide Tones to Improvisation

### Guide Tones as Melodic Anchors

**Strategy 1: Target Guide Tones**
Aim for the 3rd or 7th on strong beats (beat 1 or 3). This makes your solo clearly outline the changes.

**Strategy 2: Approach Tones**
Lead into guide tones from a half-step above or below. Creates strong, intentional sound.

**Strategy 3: Start and End on Guide Tones**
Begin each phrase on a guide tone, embellish, return to a guide tone.

### Building Lines from Guide Tones

**Basic Process:**
1. Identify guide tones for each chord
2. Connect guide tones with scale tones
3. Add chromatic approaches
4. Vary rhythm

**Example: Dm7 → G7**
- Start on F (3rd of Dm7)
- Add scale tones: F-E-D-E
- Chromatically approach B: Bb-B (3rd of G7)  
- Add more scale: B-A-G-F (7th of G7)

Result: Clear outline of changes with melodic interest!

### Guide Tone Exercises

**Exercise 1: Sing Guide Tone Lines**
Play chord progression on piano. Sing 3rd line, then 7th line. Internalize the sound.

**Exercise 2: Guide Tone Arpeggios**
Play 3-7-9-5 (or 7-3-5-9) arpeggios through changes. Skip around chord tones, highlighting guide tones.

**Exercise 3: Guide Tone Connections**
Improvise, but MUST hit either 3rd or 7th on each chord change. Forces awareness.

**Exercise 4: Guide Tone Lines in 12 Keys**
Practice ii-V-I guide tone lines (both 3rd and 7th) in all 12 keys. Build muscle memory.

## Voice Leading in Comping

### Shell Voicings
Shell voicings use only root + guide tones (3 & 7). Perfect for comping.

**Cmaj7 Shell:** C (root) + E (3rd) + B (7th)
**Dm7 Shell:** D (root) + F (3rd) + C (7th)
**G7 Shell:** G (root) + B (3rd) + F (7th)

**Advantage:** Clear, uncluttered, perfect for walking bass player + horn soloist.

### Rootless Voicings
Omit the root (bass player has it). Use guide tones + tensions.

**Cmaj7 Rootless:** E (3rd) + G (5th) + B (7th) + D (9th)
**Dm7 Rootless:** F (3rd) + A (5th) + C (7th) + E (9th)
**G7 Rootless:** B (3rd) + D (5th) + F (7th) + A (9th)

**Advantage:** Richer sound, guide tones still present.

### Comping Exercise
Play through a standard using only shell voicings. Focus on smooth guide tone voice leading between chords.

## Common Tone Movement

### What Is a Common Tone?
A note that appears in two consecutive chords. It can stay in place (no movement).

**Example: Cmaj7 → Am7**
- Cmaj7: C-E-G-B
- Am7: A-C-E-G
- Common tones: C, E, G (three notes in common!)

### Using Common Tones

**Principle:** If a note is common between chords, keep it in the same voice. Smooth!

**Example: I-vi-ii-V in C**
- **Cmaj7 → Am7:** Keep C, E, G. Move B→A.
- **Am7 → Dm7:** Keep A, C. Move E→F, G→D (or vice versa).
- **Dm7 → G7:** Keep F (common), D. Move C→B, A→G (or similar).

**Result:** Minimal motion, smooth sound.

## The Resolution of 7ths

### Natural Tendency
The 7th of any chord wants to resolve down by step.

**Example:**
- **C7 (7th = Bb):** Bb wants to resolve down to A (3rd of F)
- **Dm7 (7th = C):** C wants to resolve down to B (3rd of G7)
- **G7 (7th = F):** F wants to resolve down to E (3rd of Cmaj7)

This is why guide tones create such strong voice leading in ii-V-I!

### Satisfying Expectations
Good voice leading satisfies the listener's expectation of these resolutions. Even if you're playing "outside," knowing the expected resolution helps.

## Guide Tones with Substitutions

### Tritone Substitution and Guide Tones
When you tritone-sub a dominant chord, the guide tones stay almost the same!

**Example: G7 → Db7 (tritone sub)**
- **G7:** B (3rd), F (7th)
- **Db7:** F (3rd), Cb/B (7th)

The 3rd and 7th simply **swap roles**! This is why tritone subs work so well.

### Voice Leading Advantage
The guide tones create chromatic bass motion while maintaining harmonic clarity:
- **Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7** (normal)
- **Dm7 → Db7 → Cmaj7** (with sub)

In the sub version:
- Bass: D → Db → C (chromatic descent!)
- Guide tones: F-C → F-Cb → E-B (smooth)

## Guide Tones in Minor Keys

### Minor ii-V-i Progression
**Dm7b5 → G7(b9) → Cm(maj7)**

**Guide Tones:**
- **Dm7b5:** F (3rd), C (7th)
- **G7(b9):** B (3rd), F (7th), Ab (b9)
- **Cm(maj7):** Eb (3rd), B (7th)

**Movement:**
- F stays F (common tone)
- C → B (half-step)
- Then F → Eb (half-step), B stays B (common)

Still smooth, just with minor coloring!

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
1. **Guide tones = 3rd & 7th** → Define chord quality
2. **Good voice leading** = Minimal motion, common tones, stepwise movement
3. **Guide tone lines** = Melodic lines from 3rds or 7ths  
4. **Circle of 5ths** = Perfect guide tone voice leading
5. **Improvisation** = Target guide tones on strong beats
6. **Comping** = Use shells or rootless voicings, smooth guide tone movement
7. **Resolution** = 7ths want to resolve down by step

**Practice Routine:**
1. Play guide tone lines through standards (3rd line, then 7th line)
2. Sing guide tones while comp changes
3. Improvise, targeting guide tones on beat 1 of each chord
4. Comp through standards using only shell voicings
5. Analyze famous solos - where do they hit guide tones?

**Result:** Your playing will clearly outline harmony, sound professional, and connect smoothly through changes!
