# Ear Training and Transcription

## Why Transcribe?

**Benefits:**
- Learn authentic jazz vocabulary
- Internalize timing, phrasing, articulation
- Understand how masters navigate changes
- Build repertoire of licks/patterns
- Train your ear

**Quote:** "If you want to play jazz, you must learn the language by listening." —All jazz educators

## Transcription Process

**Step 1: Choose Recording**
Start with slow/medium tempo. Clear recording. Artist you admire.

**Step 2: Listen Repeatedly**
10-20 times before writing anything. Sing along. Internalize.

**Step 3: Identify Form**
AABA? Blues? How many bars? Key?

**Step 4: Transcribe Small Sections**
2-4 bars at a time. Loop section. Slow down if needed (software).

**Step 5: Write It Down**
Use notation or tablature. Rhythms accurate.

**Step 6: Check**
Play along with recording. Fix mistakes.

**Step 7: Analyze**
What scales? What patterns? How approach chord changes?

**Step 8: Practice**
Play transcribed solo at tempo. In all 12 keys.

## Recommended Transcriptions

**Bebop:**
- Charlie Parker: "Cool Blues" (medium blues)
- Clifford Brown: "Joy Spring" (clear articulation)

**Modal:**
- Miles Davis: "So What" (simple, melodic)
- John Coltrane: "Impressions" (Dorian exploration)

**Standards:**
- Dexter Gordon: "Body and Soul" (ballad phrasing)
- Sonny Rollins: "St. Thomas" (rhythmic mastery)

**Start:** Transcribe 8-bar sections. Build to full choruses. Eventually full solos.

## Ear Training Exercises

**Exercise 1: Sing Guide Tones**
Play chord progression. Sing 3rds, then 7ths. Internalizes harmony.

**Exercise 2: Interval Recognition**
Play two notes. Identify interval (major 3rd, perfect 5th, etc.). Use apps.

**Exercise 3: Chord Quality**
Play chord. Identify: maj7, m7, dom7, m7b5, dim7. Critical skill.

**Exercise 4: ii-V-I Ear Training**
Listen to ii-V-I in various keys. Recognize sound instantly.

**Exercise 5: Melody to Chords**
Hear melody. Figure out chords by ear. Check with recording.

## Singing

**Why Sing?**
If you can sing it, you can play it. Singing develops internal ear.

**Exercises:**
- Sing scales, arpeggios
- Sing along with solos (before transcribing)
- Scat sing over changes
- Sing what you want to play, then play it

**Goal:** Eliminate gap between hearing and playing.

## Recognizing Chord Progressions

**Common Progressions:**
- **ii-V-I:** Learn the sound. Appears everywhere.
- **I-vi-ii-V (turnaround):** End of choruses
- **Blues changes:** Memorize the sound
- **Rhythm changes (I Got Rhythm):** Fast bebop vehicle
- **Coltrane changes:** Three key centers (major 3rds)

**Practice:** Listen to standards. Identify progressions by ear before looking at chart.

## Developing Relative Pitch

**Relative Pitch** = Identify intervals, chords relative to a reference pitch.

**Process:**
- Hear one pitch (reference)
- Identify next pitch by its interval from reference
- Continue building from there

**Practice:** Play note. Sing major scale from that note. Play next note. Were you right?

**Relative vs. Perfect Pitch:**
- Perfect pitch (absolute): Rare, genetic
- Relative pitch: Learnable, sufficient for jazz

## Using Technology

**Slow-Down Software:**
- Transcribe! - Industry standard
- Amazing Slow Downer
- Audacity (free)

Slow audio without changing pitch. Essential for fast passages.

**Ear Training Apps:**
- Functional Ear Trainer
- Earmaster
- Perfect Ear
- Teoria.com

Practice intervals, chords, scales systematically.

## Transcription Goals

**Beginner:** 1 chorus/month, simple solos
**Intermediate:** 2-3 choruses/month, moderate complexity  
**Advanced:** Full solos, complex players (Coltrane, Parker)

**Lifetime Goal:** 50+ transcribed solos. Creates deep vocabulary.

## Learning from Transcriptions

**Don't just transcribe and forget!**

1. **Extract Licks:** Find 5-10 favorite licks from solo
2. **Practice in 12 Keys:** Master each lick
3. **Apply:** Use licks in your solos over similar changes
4. **Vary:** Modify rhythms, intervals
5. **Internalize:** Lick becomes part of your voice

**Result:** Authentic jazz language, not just "running scales."

## Aural Analysis

**Listen for:**
- What scale over each chord?
- Guide tones on strong beats?
- Chromaticism? Where?
- Rhythmic patterns? Syncopation?
- Phrasing? Long/short phrases?
- Space? Where are rests?
- Dynamics? Volume changes?
- Articulation? Legato, staccato, accents?

**Understanding WHY notes work = faster learning.**

## Summary

**Transcription Process:**
Listen → Sing → Write → Analyze → Practice → Apply

**Ear Training:**
- Intervals, chords, progressions
- Sing everything
- Use technology to assist
- Regular practice (15 min/day > 2 hours once/week)

**Goal:** 
Bypass eyes (reading) and fingers (patterns). Go straight: ear → mind → instrument.
