## The ii-V-I Progression

### Major ii-V-I

**The foundation of jazz harmony!**

**In C major:**
```
Dm7 | G7 | Cmaj7 | Cmaj7 |
 ii    V     I      I
```

**Voice Leading:**
```
Dm7:  D - F - A - C
G7:   D - F - B - D   (keep D, F moves down, A→B, C→D)
Cmaj7: C - E - B - E   (smooth resolution)
```

**Scale Choices:**
- **Dm7:** D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C)
- **G7:** G Mixolydian (G-A-B-C-D-E-F) OR G Altered (for tension)
- **Cmaj7:** C Lydian (C-D-E-F♯-G-A-B) OR C Major

**Practice Tips:**
1. Practice in all 12 keys (cycle of 5ths)
2. Play guide tones (3rd and 7th of each chord)
3. Notice the voice leading: 
   - F (3rd of Dm7) → F (7th of G7) → E (3rd of Cmaj7)
   - C (7th of Dm7) → B (3rd of G7) → B (7th of Cmaj7)

**Famous Examples:**
- "Autumn Leaves" (constant ii-V-I's)
- "All The Things You Are"
- "Satin Doll"

---

### Minor ii-V-i

**In C minor:**
```
Dm7♭5 | G7alt | Cm(maj7) | Cm7 |
  iiø     V       i         i
```

**Scale Choices:**
- **Dm7♭5:** D Locrian (D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭-C) OR D Locrian ♮2
- **G7alt:** G Altered scale (G-A♭-B♭-C♭-D♭-E♭-F)
- **Cm(maj7):** C Harmonic Minor (C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B)
- **Cm7:** C Dorian

**Darker sound than major ii-V-i!**

**Practice Tips:**
Focus on the chromatic voice leading:
- F (3rd of Dm7♭5) → F (7th of G7) → E♭ (3rd of Cm)
- Creates strong pull to resolution

**Famous Examples:**
- "Autumn Leaves" (B section in minor)
- "Beautiful Love"
- "Softly As In A Morning Sunrise"

---

### Extended ii-V-I (with I-VI-ii-V turnaround)

**Complete cycle:**
```
Cmaj7 | Am7 | Dm7 | G7 | Cmaj7
  I      vi    ii    V     I
```

**This is the basis of countless jazz standards!**

**Substitution Options:**
```
Cmaj7 | A7alt | Dm7 | G7 | Cmaj7
  I      ♭VI7    ii    V     I
```
(A7alt is a tritone sub approaching Dm7)

---

## Blues Progressions

### 12-Bar Blues (Traditional)

**In C:**
```
| C7  | C7  | C7  | C7  |
| F7  | F7  | C7  | C7  |
| G7  | F7  | C7  | G7  |
  1     2     3     4
  5     6     7     8
  9     10    11    12
```

**Scale Choices:**
- **C Blues scale** throughout (C-E♭-F-G♭-G-B♭)
- **C minor pentatonic** (C-E♭-F-G-B♭)
- Mix with **C major pentatonic** for variety

---

### Jazz Blues (Modern)

**With ii-V substitutions:**
```
| Cmaj7    | F7       | Cmaj7    | Cm7  F7  |
| Fm7      | B♭7      | Cmaj7    | Em7  A7  |
| Dm7      | G7       | Cmaj7 A7 | Dm7  G7  |
```

**Much more sophisticated harmony!**

**Analysis:**
- Bar 4: Borrowed from minor (Cm7-F7)
- Bar 8: ii-V to D minor
- Bar 12: Turnaround back to top

**Famous Examples:**
- Charlie Parker - "Blues for Alice"
- Thelonious Monk - "Straight No Chaser"
- Miles Davis - "Freddie Freeloader"

---

### Bird Blues (Parker Changes)

**Advanced substitutions:**
```
| Cmaj7    | Fm7  B♭7 | Em7  A7  | E♭m7 A♭7 |
| Dm7      | G7       | Cmaj7    | Em7  A7  |
| Dm7      | G7       | Cmaj7 A7 | Dm7  G7  |
```

**Contains multiple ii-V's moving through keys!**

**Bar-by-bar analysis:**
- Bar 2: ii-V to E♭
- Bar 3: ii-V to D
- Bar 4: ii-V to D♭
- Creates chromatic bass line: C-F-E-E♭-D-G-C

---

## Rhythm Changes

### "I Got Rhythm" Form

**The second most common form in jazz after blues!**

**A Section (8 bars):**
```
| B♭maj7 G7  | Cm7  F7  | B♭maj7 G7  | Cm7  F7  |
| Fm7    B♭7 | E♭maj7   | Cm7   F7   | B♭maj7   |
```

**Bridge (8 bars):**
```
| D7     | D7     | G7     | G7     |
| C7     | C7     | F7     | F7     |
```

**Structure:** AABA (32 bars total)

**Famous Examples:**
- "Oleo" - Sonny Rollins
- "Anthropology" - Charlie Parker
- "Moose the Mooche" - Charlie Parker
- "Rhythm-a-ning" - Thelonious Monk

**Practice Tips:**
1. Master the A section progression first
2. Bridge is dominant 7ths descending by 4ths: D7→G7→C7→F7
3. Practice at progressively faster tempos (bebop tunes are usually 200+ BPM!)

---

## Coltrane Changes (Giant Steps)

### The Trane Progression

**Revolutionary harmonic concept!**

**Basic cycle:**
```
| Bmaj7 D7  | Gmaj7 B♭7 | E♭maj7    | Am7  D7  |
| Gmaj7 B♭7 | E♭maj7 F♯7 | Bmaj7    | Fm7  B♭7 |
```

**Key Movement:**
The tonic moves in **major thirds**: B → G → E♭ → B

**Analysis:**
- Each major chord is approached by its V7
- Creates rapid key changes
- Extremely challenging to improvise over!

**Scale Approach:**
Must change scales every 2 beats!
```
Bmaj7: B Lydian
D7: D Mixolydian or Altered
Gmaj7: G Lydian
B♭7: B♭ Mixolydian or Altered
etc.
```

**Practice Tips:**
1. Start SLOWLY (60 BPM)
2. Practice arpeggios first before scales
3. Focus on voice leading between chords
4. Gradually increase tempo

**Famous Examples:**
- "Giant Steps" - John Coltrane (the original!)
- "Countdown" - John Coltrane
- "Fifth House" - John Coltrane

---

## Modal Progressions

### Static Modal Vamps

**Single chord for extended periods:**

**Dorian Vamp:**
```
| Dm7 | Dm7 | Dm7 | Dm7 | ...
```

**Famous Examples:**
- "So What" - Miles Davis (16 bars Dm7, 8 bars E♭m7, 8 bars Dm7)
- "Impressions" - John Coltrane

**Improvisation Approach:**
- Use D Dorian scale exclusively
- Create interest through rhythm, dynamics, phrasing
- Not through harmonic movement!

---

### Two-Chord Modal

**Alternating between two chords:**

```
| Dm7 | E♭maj7 | Dm7 | E♭maj7 |
```

**Famous Example:**
- "Maiden Voyage" - Herbie Hancock

**Improvisation:**
- Focus on the modal colors
- Smooth voice leading between modes
- Creates floating, ambiguous tonality

---

## Common Substitutions

### Tritone Substitution

**Replace V7 with ♭II7 (a tritone away)**

**Example:**
```
Original: | Dm7 | G7   | Cmaj7 |
Tritone:  | Dm7 | D♭7  | Cmaj7 |
```

**Why it works:**
- G7 = G-B-D-F
- D♭7 = D♭-F-A♭-C♭(B)
- They share the same tritone (B-F)!

**Creates chromatic bass line:** D → D♭ → C

**Famous Examples:**
- "Have You Met Miss Jones"
- "Stella By Starlight"

---

### Secondary Dominants

**Tonicize any chord by preceding it with its V7**

**Example in C major:**
```
| Cmaj7 | A7  | Dm7 | G7  | Cmaj7 |
          V/ii  ii    V     I
```

**A7 is the V of Dm, creating temporary modulation to D minor**

---

### Diminished 7th Passing Chords

**Connect diatonic chords chromatically:**

```
| Cmaj7 | C♯dim7 | Dm7 | D♯dim7 | Em7 |
```

**Each dim7 leads smoothly by half-step to next chord**

---

### ♭VI Approach

**Common in jazz standards:**

```
| Cmaj7 | A♭maj7 | Dm7 | G7 |
  I       ♭VI      ii    V
```

**Creates chromatic motion: C → A♭ → D (bass line)**

---

## Turnarounds

### I-VI-ii-V

**The classic turnaround:**

```
| Cmaj7 | Am7 | Dm7 | G7 ||
```

**With tritone sub:**
```
| Cmaj7 | A7 | Dm7 | D♭7 ||
```

**Chromatic version:**
```
| Cmaj7 | E♭7 | A♭maj7 | D♭7 ||
```

---

### Coltrane Turnaround

**Based on Giant Steps:**

```
| Cmaj7 E♭7 | A♭maj7 B7 | Emaj7 G7 | Cmaj7 ||
```

**Key movement in major thirds!**

---

## Song Form Structures

### AABA (32-bar form)

**Most common in jazz standards:**

```
A: 8 bars (main theme in tonic)
A: 8 bars (repeat)
B: 8 bars (bridge, often modulates)
A: 8 bars (return to theme)
```

**Examples:**
- "I Got Rhythm"
- "Satin Doll"
- "Anthropology"

---

### ABAC (32-bar form)

```
A: 8 bars
B: 8 bars (contrasting section)
A: 8 bars (return)
C: 8 bars (new ending)
```

**Examples:**
- "All The Things You Are"
- "Body and Soul"

---

### Blues Form (12-bar)

```
A: 4 bars
A: 4 bars (similar to first 4)
B: 4 bars (contrasting, usually turnaround)
```

## Harmonic Analysis Tips

### How to Analyze Any Standard:

1. **Identify the key center(s)**
   - Look for I, IV, V chords

2. **Find the ii-V-I progressions**
   - They're in almost every jazz tune!

3. **Spot the secondary dominants**
   - Any dominant 7th not in the key

4. **Notice substitutions**
   - Tritone subs
   - Diminished passing chords

5. **Identify the form**
   - AABA? ABAC? Blues?

## Voice Leading Principles

### Smooth Voice Leading Rules:

1. **Move voices by the smallest interval possible**
   - Common tones stay, other voices move by step or half-step

2. **Guide tones (3rd and 7th) move in contrary or oblique motion**
   - In ii-V-I: 3rd becomes 7th, 7th becomes 3rd

3. **Avoid parallel perfect 5ths and octaves**
   - Classic counterpoint rule still applies in jazz

4. **Use voice leading to create chromatic lines**
   - Especially in the bass and inner voices
