# Reharmonization and Chord Substitution

## Tritone Substitution

### The Concept
Replace any dominant 7th chord with another dominant 7th chord a tritone (3 whole steps / 6 half steps) away.

**Example:** G7 → Db7

### Why It Works
The 3rd and 7th are inverted:
- **G7:** B (3rd), F (7th)
- **Db7:** F (3rd), Cb/B (7th)

Same guide tones, different root! Creates chromatic bass motion.

### Application on ii-V-I
**Original:** Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
**Substitution:** Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7

**Bass motion:** D → Db → C (smooth chromatic descent!)

### When to Use
- On V7 chords going to I
- Creates sophisticated, modern sound
- Common in bebop and later styles

### Practice
Play ii-V-I with tritone sub in all 12 keys. Get comfortable with both bass roots.

## Secondary Dominants

### Definition
A dominant 7th chord that resolves to a chord other than the tonic. Temporarily tonicizes a non-tonic chord.

### Common Secondary Dominants
- **V7/ii:** A7 → Dm7 (in C major)
- **V7/iii:** B7 → Em7
- **V7/vi:** E7 → Am7
- **V7/V:** D7 → G7

### Example Progression
**Original:** Cmaj7 - Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
**With Secondary Dominants:** Cmaj7 - A7 - Dm7 - D7 - G7 - Cmaj7

Each dominant resolves down a fifth to the next chord.

### Creating Secondary Dominants
**Step 1:** Identify target chord
**Step 2:** Find root a fifth above target
**Step 3:** Make it dominant 7th
**Step 4:** Insert before target

**Example:** Going to Dm7? Add A7 before it.

### Backdoor ii-V
Approaching I from bVII7:
- **Cmaj7** ← **Fm7 - Bb7** (from Eb major)
- Creates minor plagal sound
- Alternative to normal V7

## Modal Interchange

### Concept
Borrow chords from parallel minor/major. Adds color while staying in key.

### Common Borrowed Chords (in Major)
- **iv minor:** Fm7 (from C minor) in C major
- **bVI:** Abmaj7 (from C minor) in C major
- **bVII:** Bb7 (from C minor/mixolydian) in C major
- **bIII:** Ebmaj7 (from C minor) in C major

### Example
**Original:** Cmaj7 - Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7
**With Modal Interchange:** Cmaj7 - Fm7 - G7 - Cmaj7

Fm7 (iv minor) creates darker, more emotional sound.

### Minor to Major Borrowing
Can borrow major chords when in minor:
- **IV major:** Fmaj7 (from C major) in C minor
- **V major:** G major (from C harmonic minor)

## Diminished Chord Substitutions

### Passing Diminished
Insert dim7 chord between two chords a whole step apart.

**Example:** Cmaj7 → Dm7
**Add:** Cmaj7 → C#dim7 → Dm7

Bass moves chromatically: C → C# → D

### Diminished as Dominant Substitute
Any dim7 can substitute for dominant 7th chord a half-step below.

**G7 can be replaced by:**
- G#dim7 (or Bdim7, Ddim7, Fdim7 - all same chord!)

Dim7 chords are symmetrical - every minor 3rd is same chord.

## Approach Chords

### Concept
Add a chord a half-step above OR below target chord.

**Types:**
1. **Chromatic approach from above:** Db7 → Cmaj7
2. **Chromatic approach from below:** B7 → Cmaj7
3. **Diatonic approach:** Dm7 → Cmaj7

### Example
**Target:** Em7
**Approaches:** 
- From above: F7 → Em7 or Fmaj7 → Em7
- From below: Eb7 → Em7 or Ebmaj7 → Em7

Creates anticipation and smooth voice leading.

## Coltrane Changes (Giant Steps)

### The Innovation
Rapidly moving key centers in thirds (major 3rds cycle).

**Giant Steps Progression:**
- B → D7 → G → Bb7 → Eb → Am7-D7 (repeat pattern)

Key centers: B, Eb, G (three keys equally spaced - augmented triad!)

### Strategy
Think in three keys simultaneously. Divide tune into three sections, one key each.

**Practice:**
1. Play ii-V-I in B major
2. Play ii-V-I in Eb major
3. Play ii-V-I in G major
4. Connect them quickly

### Related Songs
- "Giant Steps" (Coltrane)
- "Countdown" (Coltrane)
- "Moment's Notice" (Coltrane)

Requires mastery of ii-V-I in all keys at fast tempos!

## Pedal Point

### Definition
Sustaining one bass note while harmony changes above it.

**Example:**
Bass holds C while chords change: Cmaj7 - Dm7 - Em7 - Fmaj7 (all over C bass)

### Creates Tension
When upper chord doesn't contain bass note, creates tension.

**Example:** Em7/C (E-G-B-D over C)
- Creates Cmaj9 sound
- Rich, ambiguous harmony

### Application
Modal tunes often use pedal points. Creates open, floating feeling.

## Reharmonizing a Melody

### Process
1. Identify melody notes
2. Find multiple chords containing melody note
3. Choose chords that create interesting motion
4. Maintain functional harmony (tension/resolution)

### Example: "Happy Birthday" First Phrase
**Melody:** C-C-D-C-F-E

**Original Harmony:** C - C - G7 - C
**Reharmonization 1:** Cmaj7 - A7 - Dm7 - G7 - C6
**Reharmonization 2:** Cmaj7 - Eb7 - Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7

Each melody note must be chord tone or acceptable tension.

### Guidelines
- Melody note = chord tone, 9th, 11th, or 13th
- Avoid melody note = b9 on major chords (harsh)
- More chord changes = more sophisticated sound
- Maintain harmonic rhythm appropriate to style

## Slash Chords / Upper Structure

### Notation
**Dm7/G** = Play Dm7 triad over G bass
- Results in G9sus sound (G-A-C-D-F)

### Common Upper Structures
- **Dm7/C:** Cmaj9 sound
- **Ebmaj7/C:** Cmaj7#11 sound  
- **Fmaj7/G:** G13sus sound
- **Bmaj7/C:** C7#9#5 sound (altered dominant)

### Application
Creates rich, complex harmony with simple shapes. Popular in contemporary jazz.

## Practical Reharmonization Steps

### Step 1: Learn the Original
Master standard harmony before reharmonizing.

### Step 2: Identify Functional Points
Where is the V7-I? Where are ii-V progressions? These are anchors.

### Step 3: Add Passing Chords
Between anchor chords, add chromatic approaches, secondary dominants, diminished chords.

### Step 4: Substitute Dominants
Try tritone subs on V7 chords.

### Step 5: Modal Interchange
Borrow chords from parallel minor/major.

### Step 6: Test It
Does melody still sound good? Does harmony make sense? Too complex?

## Common Reharmonization Formulas

### Formula 1: Diatonic + Secondary Dominants
**I - vi - ii - V** becomes
**I - V7/vi - vi - V7/ii - ii - V**

### Formula 2: Tritone Sub Chain
**ii - V - I** becomes
**ii - bII7 - I** (Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7)

### Formula 3: Diminished Insertions
**I - IV** becomes
**I - #Idim7 - ii - #iidim7 - iii**

### Formula 4: Coltrane-Style Key Centers
Divide tune into three keys (major thirds apart), create ii-V-I in each.

## Summary

**Key Substitution Types:**
1. **Tritone Sub:** Replace V7 with bII7
2. **Secondary Dominants:** V7 of non-tonic chords
3. **Modal Interchange:** Borrow from parallel minor/major
4. **Diminished:** Passing dim7 chords, dim7 as dom7 sub
5. **Approach Chords:** Half-step above/below target
6. **Coltrane Changes:** Key centers in major 3rds
7. **Upper Structures:** Triads over different bass notes

**Practice Routine:**
1. Take simple standard (e.g., "Autumn Leaves")
2. Apply one substitution type at a time
3. Hear how each changes the sound
4. Combine techniques gradually
5. Always test with melody - does it still work?

**Goal:** Expand harmonic palette while maintaining musical coherence.
