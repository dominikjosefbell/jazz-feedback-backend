# Comping and Accompaniment

## Shell Voicings
Root + 3rd + 7th only. Clear, functional. Perfect for walking bass + soloist.
**Cmaj7:** C-E-B | **Dm7:** D-F-C | **G7:** G-B-F

## Rootless Voicings
Omit root (bassist has it). Add 9th, tensions.
**Cmaj7:** E-G-B-D | **Dm7:** F-A-C-E | **G7:** B-D-F-A

**Advantage:** Richer sound, no clash with bass.

## Drop 2 Voicings
Take closed voicing, drop 2nd note from top down one octave.
**Cmaj7 closed:** C-E-G-B → **Drop 2:** E-G-B-C (on guitar/piano)

Creates singable top note (melody), good voice leading.

## Quartal Voicings (Fourths)
Stack perfect 4ths instead of thirds. Modal, open sound.
**Example:** C-F-Bb-Eb (all 4ths) = Cm11 or Ebmaj9 sound

**Used in:** Modal jazz (McCoy Tyner), modern jazz

## Comping Rhythm Patterns

**Pattern 1: Charleston**
"& 2 & (rest)" - Classic swing comp rhythm

**Pattern 2: Syncopated Hits**
Accent upbeats, avoid beat 1 (let bassist have it)

**Pattern 3: Montuno (Latin)**
Rhythmic pattern repeated. Lock with bass, clave.

**Rule:** Leave space! Don't comp constantly during solos.

## Chord Melody
Play melody + harmony simultaneously (guitar/piano).
- Melody = top note
- Harmony = inner voices

**Practice:** Take standard, harmonize melody with drop 2 voicings.

## Walking Comp (Piano)
Left hand walks bass line, right hand comps chords.

**Bass pattern:** Root → 5th → 3rd → passing tone

**Comp:** Stab chords on 2 & 4, or syncopated.

## Listening to Soloist
**React to:** 
- Soloist's rhythm → Match their energy
- Soloist's dynamics → Play softer when they play soft
- Soloist's space → Don't fill every gap

**Goal:** Conversation, not accompaniment track.

## Voicing Motion
Guide tones move smoothly (see Guide Tones section). Minimize motion between chords.

**Example: Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7**
Keep common tones, move others by step.

## Summary
- **Shell = Clear, sparse**
- **Rootless = Rich, modern**
- **Drop 2 = Melodic top**
- **Quartal = Open, modal**
- **Space = Essential**
- **Listen = React to soloist**
